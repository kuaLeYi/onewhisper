## Simple
>Mathematics is a methodical application of quantity, structure,
>space and change. Ergo, the subject can make its students
>methodical or systematic. Mathematical education also brings order
>to oneâ€™s way of life and promotes qualities such as the power of
>reasoning, creativity, abstract or spatial thinking, critical
>thinking, problem-solving ability and even effective communication
>skills.

An easy way to deal with this comes to mind: automation. This is why today, trillions of sets of random mathematical challenges are available at a touch in [Onewhisper](https://kualeyi.github.io/onewhisper)'s undemanding-to-use interface.
## Recommendations
If you are a question-setter, do make edits to any questions and solutions generated in order for them to suit your educational intention.
